# MUSE vs Word2Vec interleaving for translations

## Orchestrated training of models
The training is demonstrated in the training_and_evaluating jupyter notebook. Both MUSE and W2V models can be trained and evaluated jointly for multiple configurations. 

## MUSE model training using GPU

For faster MUSE training, Google Colab was used notebooks were used, as GPU cuda can be utilized for adversarial training. I also provide [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aUaIUBeiEd7Y_OpiGxEj4U4I0Imh11-9?usp=sharing) for this purpose.
